      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are and how we use them. You
        should read this policy so you can understand what type of cookies we
        use, the information we collect using cookies and how that information
        is used. For more details about your personal information, please refer
        to our Privacy policy. This Policy also tells you what your rights are
        in relation to the personal data you give to us. If you have any
        questions about this Cookie policy please contact us at;

      <h2>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files sent by a web server to your browser when
        you access the Website. Cookies are classified into two major
        categories: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are
        temporarily stored on your device while you are visiting a given
        Website. They are deleted once you leave the Website. Persistent
        cookies, on the other hand, remain on your device for a more extended
        period of time specified in the cookie file, after you leave the
        Website. This type of cookie remains available for retrieval by the web
        server when you return to visit the website. <br />
        Cookies are further classified into "first-party cookies" and
        "third-party cookies". First-party cookies are those sent to your
        browser by the server of the Website you are visiting. Third-party
        cookies are those sent to your browser by servers other than the Website
        you are visiting (e.g., the server of an advertising network to which
        the Website you are visiting is subscribed).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>TYPES OF COOKIES WE ARE USING?</h2>
      <p>
        When Users visit our platform to use our services, we place the
        following cookies for them:

            Google Analytics sets this cookie to calculate visitor, session and

          amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy
          preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser
          to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site
          will not work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable

        <li>
          <span>Performance cookies -</span> These cookies allow us to count
          visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the

          your visits to the Site and other websites, alternate the ads sent to
          a specific computer, and track how often an ad has been viewed and by
          whom. These cookies are linked to a computer and do not gather any

          best and what features on the Site can be improved.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Third-Party Cookies -</span> These cookies may be placed on your
          computer when you visit the Site by companies that run certain
          services we offer. These cookies allow third parties to gather and
          track certain information about you. These cookies can be manually

        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>HOW CAN I CONTROL OR DELETE COOKIES?</h2>
      <p>There are many ways to manage your cookies:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>You can refuse your consent (Opt-Out);</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You can disable third-party cookies by using your browser settings; or
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          You can use our cookie management tool to disable third-party cookies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Control via your browser settings</h2>
      <p>
        Most internet browsers are initially set up to automatically accept
        cookies. If you do not want our Website to store cookies on your device,
        you can change your browser settings so that you receive a warning
        before certain cookies are stored. You can also adjust your settings so
        that your browser refuses most of our cookies or only certain cookies
        from third parties. You can also withdraw your consent to cookies by
        deleting the cookies that have already been stored.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you disable the cookies that we use, this may impact your experience
        on the Website, for example, you may not be able to visit certain areas
        of a Website or you may not receive personalized information when you
        visit a Website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you use different devices to view and access the Website (e.g., your
        computer, smartphone, or tablet) you will need to ensure that each
        browser on each device is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The procedures for changing your settings and cookies differ from
        browser to browser. If necessary, use the help function on your browser
        or click on one of the links below to go directly to the user manual for
        your browser.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>INTERNET EXPLORER</li>
        <li>MOZILLA FIREFOX</li>
        <li>GOOGLE CHROME</li>
        <li>SAFARI</li>
        <li>OPERA</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition, most browsers offer a so-called “Do-not-track function”,
        with which you can state that you do not wish to be “tracked” by the
        Website. If this function is activated, the respective browser informs
        advertising networks, websites and applications that you do not want to
        be tracked for behavioural advertising or similar. To enable the “do not
        track” option in your browser follow the respective link below:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>FIREFOX</li>
        <li>INTERNET EXPLORER</li>
        <li>MICROSOFT EDGE</li>
        <li>GOOGLE CHROME</li>
        <li>SAFARI</li>
        <li>OPERA</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Other cookie management tools</h2>
      <p>
        In addition, you may opt out of some third-party cookies through the
        <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F"
          >Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool</a
        >. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can
        visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”)

          >educational page</a
        >.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to cookies, we may use pixel tags, and other tracking
        technologies on the Site to help customize the Site and improve your
        experience. A “pixel tag” is a tiny object or image embedded in a web
        page or email. They are used to track the number of users who have
        visited particular pages and viewed emails, and acquire other
        statistical data. They collect only a limited set of data, such as a
        cookie number, time and date of page or email view, and a description of
        the page or email on which they reside. Pixel tags cannot be declined.
        However, you can limit their use by controlling the cookies that
        interact with them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>CHANGES TO THE COOKIE POLICY</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant
        changes, we will let you know through email/ notifications, but please
        check this policy regularly to ensure you are aware of the most updated
        version.
